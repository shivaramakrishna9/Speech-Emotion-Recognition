# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to build a system capable of detecting emotions from human speech signals. By leveraging advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques, the model will be trained to classify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality from speech data.
