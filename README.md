# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to build a system capable of detecting emotions from human speech signals. By leveraging advanced signal processing and deep learning techniques, the model will be trained to classify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality from speech data.

# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

## Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a field of machine learning focused on analyzing human speech to detect emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based model for classifying emotions from speech signals using modern signal processing techniques.

The goal is to create an emotion recognition system that can be used in real-time applications such as mental health assessment, customer service, and interactive human-computer interfaces. By accurately identifying emotional states, the system aims to enhance communication and improve user experiences.

## Problem Statement
Effective communication involves not just the transmission of information but also the expression of emotions. Recognizing emotions in speech helps improve interactions, whether in customer support, mental health applications, or human-computer interaction systems. The objective of this project is to build a model that classifies emotions in speech, using deep learning and signal processing techniques to achieve high classification accuracy in real-time systems.

## Key Features
- **Emotion Classification**: Detects and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality from audio speech data.
- **Real-Time Application**: Focuses on building a system capable of recognizing emotions in real-time, enhancing user interaction in various domains.
- **Signal Processing & Deep Learning**: Utilizes modern signal processing techniques (e.g., MFCC features) and deep learning models (e.g., CNN, LSTM, etc.) for emotion detection.
- **Speech Dataset**: Trains the model on labeled speech datasets with emotions expressed in various voice signals.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementing the system.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Deep learning libraries used for training and evaluating the emotion recognition model.
- **Librosa**: Python library for audio processing, used for feature extraction like MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for implementing classifiers and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization and result plotting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Librosa
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Steps to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Emotion Recognition Script:

bash
Copy
python emotion_recognition.py
The model will process the input speech and classify it into one of the predefined emotions (happy, sad, angry, or neutral).

Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify the emotions in any speech sample. The system takes an audio input, processes it, and outputs the detected emotion, providing insights that can be used in customer support systems, interactive chatbots, and mental health monitoring applications.

Expected Outcome
The project aims to build a robust and accurate emotion recognition system for speech that can be used in real-time applications. The model's performance in detecting emotions with high accuracy will help improve user interactions and emotional engagement in various domains.
